<h1> John Benedict Cruz </h1>
<p> 	I’m John Benedict Cruz, you can call me JB and I’m 19 years old. I live at Mandaluyong City with my grandfather, uncle and my sister because my mother and father cannot support us
because they are separated since my third sibling is born. I’m graduated junior high school and senior high school in Jose Rizal University at Mandaluyong.
</p>
</p>
On my second year high school I don’t have any friends In my section because I’m new on their section and my classmate know all their classmate except me.
After 1 month I have 2 friends which is my seatmate, their so funny and they also like basketball and billiard I always with them in lunch time.
So we have a teacher and asking us if we see the imaginary line in the projector, no one is raising their hands so she pick on her attendance and that’s me
and she ask me if I see the imaginary line but I don’t know what it is so I said yes and my classmate are laughing so loud and my teacher also.
And she ask me again “if you see the imaginary line where in this classroom?” and I point out the metal near in our entrance door and there are
laughing again and my teacher told me that I don’t allowed to seat because of my answer. In the next day my all classmate called me imaginary line just to tease me
and they become my friend.
</p>
<p>
I spend my summer in our house because I don’t have money to have a great summer and yeah it's sad. When I’m in our house I always do the house hold chores and when I’m finish all
the chores I will rest and I will be watching movies or episode in Netflix and sometimes I’m playing mobile games.
